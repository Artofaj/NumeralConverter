# Roman numeral converter

This is a sample project for teaching a group of school children who are currently learning Roman numerals.

The goal is to create a basic tool that can convert a Roman numeral to and from an integer.

The scope of this project is:

- Include a simple UI for the children to input and receive conversions between Roman numerals and integers.
- Implement RomanNumerals.toRoman(1000); // should return 'M'.
- Implement RomanNumerals.fromRoman('M'); // should return 1000.
- When the inputs equal 0, an error is propagated and the value is set to 1.
- Inputs only accept valid charachters.
- A cheatsheet can be seen as a guideline.
- A short description of the numerals is given as background information.
